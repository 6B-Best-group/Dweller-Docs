Data information
========================

All data information that impacts inputs and the database is held within the dataInfo file.
Within the file is a map the holds the maximium amount of characters that can be entered into the
database.

This can be called from other files when adding frontend limits to inputs and backend 
checks before data is sent to the database and is simple to change if the needs of the 
user or database requires this.
